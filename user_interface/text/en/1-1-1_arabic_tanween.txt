In standard Arabic, the optional [-n] sound at the end of nouns is called "Tanween" or "Nunation". Tanween does not change the meaning of the word. You must figure out when to and when not to use tanween over time as you see more examples. At the end of the lesson, speech recognition (i.e. talking to your device microphone) will accept both; you may say it either with or without Tanween.
